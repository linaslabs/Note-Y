<h1> Overview </h1>

This application gives the user the functionality to create, edit, search and delete their own personal notes.
Inspired by the constant urge to note down an idea, or plan a list of things to do for the day.
Along with my drive to explore the technologies associated with back-end development, I decided to embark on creating this web application.
I've also tried styling it the best I could with vanilla CSS, the aimm was to have a consistent theme throughout the website

<h2> Functionality </h2>

The web application implements:
- Google Oauth2.0 authentication
- CRUD operations with a MongoDB non-relational database to create new notes, view all current notes, update notes and delete specified notes
- Search functionalities using regex expressions to find the terms listed in the database
- HTML and JS operated text editor to enable basic styling to the notes!
